Phase 0 - Sandbox
-Test KPBS compatibility w/ Simple Construction
-Test RPM, Docking Alignment, kOSPropMonitor
-Test Feline Rovers
-Test Simple Construction: Base, Rover, Rocket
-Test StageRecovery: Powered and re-entry
-Test LifeSupport
-Test ITS:
	-Just too overpowered?
	-Switching tank types/composition?
	-Carrying actual cargo?
-Test Reusability Expansion for Dragon suitability
-Design production fleet:
	-http://imgur.com/a/YG9IH
	-Dragon Crew - Using Taurus HCV Mod (investigate powered landing, moduleManager patch for service bay)
	-Dragon Cargo - Using Phoenix Industries Mod (investigate altering parts from KIS to containers)
	-Falcon9-alike
	-FalconHeavy-alike
	-TAPE’s craft?
	-Test cargo performance w/ NRAP
-Launch script (KSC to 100km)
-Re-Entry script (100km to KSC)


Phase 1 - LKO Ops
—Start career w/ 2500 Science + 2.5m Funds
-Station intercept (100km to 250km)
-Station return (250km to 100km)
-Basic station construction (lab, lifeSupport, docking)
-Docking script
(After phase 1, tested lifters w/ in-envelope cargo can “cheat” to basic station and land w/ StageRecovery)

Phase 2 - HKO Ops
-Mun/Min transfer script (100km to Mun/Min)
-Direct launch Mun script
-Direct launch Min script
-Parking orbit script (fly-by to 50/30km/0inc)
-Return script (MoonParking to Kerbin 100km-notInclined)
(After phase 2, tested lifters w/ in-envelope cargo can “cheat” to MoonParking, KerbinParking, and land w/ stageRecovery
